# Moslem Productivity Tools

Hi there, according to the research, we will be more productive when we take break more frequently during works. Some say the golden ratio between walk and rest is 52:17, and some say that we should take a rest every time we work continously every 90 minutes. Therefore, I try to create this little app to track my work and rest time, and remind me to take a break every x minutes or so. You can find the final website [here](https://wahidyankf.github.io/moslem-productivity-tools/index.html).
