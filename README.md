# Moslem Productivity Tools

Doing more work doesn't always equal to more productivity throughput. Just as research shown, we need enough rest between our working session. Therefore, I try to create this little app to track my work and rest time, and remind me to take a break whenever I am about to burn out (52 minutes work - 17 minutes rest). You can find the final website [here](https://wahidyankf.github.io/moslem-productivity-tools/index.html).
